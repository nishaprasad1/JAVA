 * Multitasking:
 * 	 executing several task simutaneously is the concept of multitasking.There are
 * 		two types of multitasking:
 * 		1.Process based multitasking
 * 		2.Thread based multitasking
 * 				
 * 1.Process based multitasking
 * 		Executing several task simultaneously where each task is a separate 
 * 	independent program(process) is called process based multitasking.
 * eg:- while typing a java program in an editor we can listen audio songs from
 * 		same system at same time we can download a file from net all these tasks
 * 		will be executed simultaneously and independent from each other hence it
 * 		is process based multitasking.
 * --> process based multitasking is best suitable at OS level.
 * 
 * 2.Thread based multitasking
 * 		Executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate
 * 		independent part of the same program is called thread based multitasking,
 * 		and each independent part is called a thread.
 * --> thread based multitasking is best suitable at programatic level.
 * 
 * Note: whether it is process based or thread based the main objective of 
 * 		multitasking is to reduce response time of the system and to improve
 * 		performance.

The main importance application areas of MT are:
1. to develope multi media graphics
2. animation
3. develop video games
4. to deveop web servers and application servers

--> when compared with old languages developing multithreaded application in java
is very easy because java provides in built support for multithreading with rich
API { Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup...}
