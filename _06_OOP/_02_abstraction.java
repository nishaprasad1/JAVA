/*
 * 1. hiding internal implementation and just highlight the set of services
 * 		what we are offering is the concept of abstraction.
 * 		eg:- through bank ATM GUI screen bank people are highlighting the set of services
 * 				what they are offering without highlighting internal implementation.
 * 2. the main advantages of abstraction are:-
 * 	a)Security: we can achieve security because we are not highlighting our internal
 * 		 implementation.
 *  b)Enhancement is easy: without effecting outside person we can able to perform any
 *  	type of changes in our internal system and hence enhancement will become easy.
 *  c) Maintainability: it improves maintainability of the application.
 *  d)Easiness: it improves easiness to improve our system.
 *  
 *  3. by using interface and abstract classes we can implement abstraction.
