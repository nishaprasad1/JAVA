/*
 * 1.outside person cannot access our internal data directly or our internal data
 * 		should not go out directly this feature is called data hiding. After validation
 * 		or authentication outside person can access internal data.
 * 		eg:-a)after providing proper username and password we can able to access our
 * 				gmail inbox information
 * 			b)even though we are valid bank customer we can able to access our account 
 * 				information and we cannot access other's account information.
 * 
 * 2. by declaring data member(variable) as private we can acieve data hiding.
 			class Account{
				private double balance;
				public double getBalance() {
					return balance;
				}
			}
 * 3. the main advantage of data hiding is security
 * Note: it is highly recommended to declare data member(variable) as private.
