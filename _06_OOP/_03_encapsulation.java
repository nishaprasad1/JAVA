/*
 * 1. the process of binding data and coressponding methods into a single
 * 		unit is nothing but encapsulation.Every class is an example of encapsulation
 			eg:-
 			class Student{
 				data member
 					+
 				methods(behaviours)
 			
 			}
 *
 * 2. if any component follows data hiding and abstraction such type of component is said
 * 		 to be encapsulated component.
 * 		-----------------------------------------------
 * 		|	ENCAPSULATION = DATA HIDING + ABSTRACTION |
 *      -----------------------------------------------
       			class Account{
					private double balance;
					public double getBalance() {
						return balance;
					}
					public void setBalance(double balance) {
						this.balance = balance;
					}
				}
 *
 * 3. the main advantages of encapsulation are:
 * 		a)we can achieve security
 * 		b)enhancement will become easy
 * 		c)it improves maintainability of the application
 * 4. the main advantage of encapsulation is security but the main disadvantage
 * 		is it increases lenght of code and slow's down execution.
